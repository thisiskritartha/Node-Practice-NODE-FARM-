# Node-Practice-NODE-FARM-

Here is the Day 1 of learning Node js from the UDEMY.
Today, I learned about fs(file system), http, url modules as well as port and hostname.
fs can be used synchronously(blocking) as well as asynchronously(non-blocking) to read or write the file as per the need.
http can be use to createServer and listen the server.
